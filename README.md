# Chris Jones | Penetration Tester & Security-Focused Developer

Cybersecurity professional specializing in offensive security and secure application development. I combine hands-on penetration testing expertise with full-stack development skills to build tools that solve real security challenges.

## About Me

I'm passionate about breaking things to understand how they work—and then building them back better. My work spans vulnerability research, exploit development, and creating secure applications that prioritize both functionality and defense-in-depth principles.

Currently active in CTF competitions and penetration testing challenges, with a focus on web application security, reverse engineering, and infrastructure exploitation.
